<h1>Analyzing Forensic Evidence <h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab, I used P2 Commander to investigate an image of a hard drive to find forensic evidence without impacting the integrity of the data on the image. I created an electronic case file showing the creation of a case, the addition of the evidence file which I had to save for later review. Using this method I experienced all of the steps necessary for a sound forensic investigation that will preserve the source and ensure the evidence is defensible and presentable in a court of law.
